                <p>despite developers all but abandoning the game, the commuity holds strong. From the very beguining of the game there have been community servers running gamemodes not possible in casual tf2. The steam workshop is also a testiment to the dedication to the game that the community holds dear. With constant uploads, its easy to see the hours people pour into this game</p>
